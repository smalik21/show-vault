Once an Olympic hopeful, bodyguard to Irans Shah and pop culture icon, we witness Vaziri struggling with addiction and despair as a family man. But with the help of Torontos Magen brothers, the Sheik begins a road to redemption and renewed status as a public figure.  Showcasing his powerful past and at times painful present, this is an insightful look at one of wrestlings biggest stars, but also a powerful story of personal sacrifice that, in the Sheiks own words, will make you humble.",

In January 2010, NBC announced that due to affiliate concerns about its effect on their newscasts, The Jay Leno Show would be shortened to 30 minutes and moved from primetime to 11:35 p.m., the timeslot that had been occupied by The Tonight Show for nearly 60 years.\n\nThe Tonight Show host Conan O'Brien released a public statement saying that he would not participate in moving Tonight to 12:05 a.m., asserting that it would damage the highly respected franchise. Despite much support for O'Brien from both the public and media professionals alike NBC maintained its plan to move Leno to 11:35. On January 21, 2010, NBC reached a $45 million settlement with O'Brien in order to end his contract. Leno resumed his duties as host of Tonight on March 1, 2010. Leno ended on February 9, 2010 after being on the air for only four months, with Entertainment Weekly calling the program television's \"Biggest Bomb of All Time.\"",

He is a coffee-fueled long-haul trucker who embraces his own nudity as the ultimate example of American freedom. T-Bones is a freeloading drifter who's rarely seen without his ball-peen hammer or bottle of sweet wine. Often underestimated, T-Bones surprises many, including Trucker, with his cunning and depth of knowledge.\n\nThe duo has performed live on Late Night with Conan O'Brien as well as Real Time with Bill Maher. They also have played various dates with Tenacious D.\n\nTheir signature song, \"My American Dream,\" features a unique description of an ideal America. T-Bones also sings \"My Daddy Is an Astronaut,\" a tragicomic tale of his fatherless childhood believing that Buzz Aldrin is his dad.",

Laser Fart delighted audiences with its ironically epic feel and came breathtakingly close to breaking The 'Bu's record for longest running show. Then, in July of 2005, a weary Harmon wrote a ridiculous, slapdash script and the always hungry audience moved down the buffet, never looking back. This coincided with the \"takeover\" of 101 at the hands of a new generation of leaner, meaner (well, nicer), post-ironic underdogs like J.D. Ryznar, Ryan Ridley, Justin Roiland and the once-cursed Valley Pals. Laser Fart stands as a 101 legend and a cautionary tale: No artist has immunity, no show has true momentum.
